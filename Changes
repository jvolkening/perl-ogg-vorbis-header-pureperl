    - Allow multiple comment keys of the same type for Vorbis comments.

    - Skip ID3 tags if they exist.

    - Ogg tag parser was badly broken and would fail if the amount of tag
      data was > 8K or exceeded one page.  Rewrote the comment parsing
      routine based on code from Image::ExifTool::Vorbis.  Also fixed the
      cover art code as it was also broken: from Andy Grundman
